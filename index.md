# Your Title should go in the appropriate place in `index.html`, not here! Title is itself set only in the `<head>` element

## Use headings only if you want to have



Add your content here, including _markup_ of **various kinds**. Now you can just write! But you should be aware of a couple of advanced fipt function links. I've written a simple function that will seek to a particular time code in seconds.  You can call it like this: `<a href="javascript:seek(75)">seek to 1:15</a>`, but `[seek to 1:15](javascript:seek(75))` won't render properly, so you have to type the whole linke in, as seen here: <a href="#" onclick="javascript:seek(75)"> seek to 1:15</a>.
  - also, Remarkable supports pandoc-style footnotes, which can be helpful sometimes. Here are some examples of footnotes at work:

    Footnote 1 link[^first].

    Footnote 2 link[^second].

    Inline footnote^[Text of inline footnote] definition.

    Duplicated footnote reference[^second].

you can learn more about remarkable on [its github page](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable), and get a fuller sense of the syntax [in the online demo](https://jonschlinkert.github.io/remarkable/demo/)


[^first]: Footnote **can have markup**

    and multiple paragraphs.

[^second]: Footnote text.
